# Thermal-Mechanical-Beahaviour-of-Solar-Panel
Modeling and simulate the thermal-mechanical behaviour for a 2D solar panel via FEM method

gmsh is used for CAD model design and discretization control, thus the package needs to be installed

The main process can be divided into 2 parts:
1. thermal heat transfer behaviour analysis
2. mechanical behaviour with heat flux (thermal stress)

The core function: KU = F
K: stiffness
U: could be any mechanical response we want to get and analysis, generally it's displacement(deformation/deflextion/rotation/...)
F: any output energy, normally it's force, could be heat flux, vibration, wind
General procedures of modeling and simulation via finite element method are:
create design domain -> discretize domain into elements -> control function establish on element level (and solve or later) -> assemble all element into global mattrix Assemble global stiffness matrix K and RHS r combining step1
