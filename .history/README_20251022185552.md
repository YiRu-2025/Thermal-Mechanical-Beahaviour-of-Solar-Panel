# Thermal-Mechanical-Beahaviour-of-Solar-Panel
Modeling and simulate the thermal-mechanical behaviour for a 2D solar panel via FEM method

## theory
gmsh is used for CAD model design and discretization control, thus the package needs to be installed

The main process can be divided into 2 parts:
1. thermal heat transfer behaviour analysis
2. mechanical behaviour with heat flux (thermal stress)

The core function: KU = F
K: stiffness
U: could be any mechanical response we want to get and analysis, generally it's displacement(deformation/deflextion/rotation/...)
F: any output energy, normally it's force, could be heat flux, vibration, wind
General procedures of modeling and simulation via finite element method are:
create design domain -> discretize domain into elements -> control function establish on element level (and solve or later) -> assemble all element into global mattrix Assemble global stiffness matrix K and RHS r (combining previous step) -> apply boundary conditions and solve the function -> post-processing and data visualization

for Mechanical CST function

Start with: a mesh + a nodal temperature vector T

Imposing thermal coupling by Constitutive Law:

σ = C : (ε - εt)

εt = α · ΔT · I,

ε = [εxx εyy εxy] = [dU/dx dU/dy dU/dy+dU/dx] = B · U

Goal: Obtain elementary stiffness Ke and elementary force vector fe

## modeling and simulation results
run modelget.py, we can get the descretized solar panel model:

run thermal.py, we can get the thermal behaviour of model:
temperature distribution: ![temperature](image-1.png)
heat flux vector: ![heatflux](image-2.png)

run thermomechanical.py, we can get the mechanical response with all previous figures (model and thermal behavior):
